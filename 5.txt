in route : web.php -> defined routes in our web application with the methods for every pages will be in this file
sometimes we may have multiple methods via a single page
this web.php is essentially work by a middleware called web that is used in RouteServiceProvider
and this provider is being registered (bootstrapped) in config/app.php / providers array
api.php -> like web it has a api middleware and the usage is 
to define api to recieve or send data,like front end developer uses these apis to enteract with our backend

in resources folder we have all static files containing html,css,javascript for every pages,and the usage of blade template engine
is here and we must define pages for every routes according to the method type
(php artisan make:view posts.index) creates index.php in folder of posts in views

but in route/web.php Route::resource('posts') will create all crud for posts (convention over configuration)
